### On Mac OS

There are multiple ways to run the application on macOS:

#### Option 1: Use Docker to prepare a macOS build package (Recommended)

This approach uses Docker to create a ready-to-build package that can be easily built on macOS:

1. On any system with Docker installed, run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader.git
   cd homeconnect-profile-downloader
   ./build-macos.sh
   ```

2. Copy the generated `./out/build/homeconnect-profile-downloader-macos-package.tar.gz` to your Mac

3. On your Mac, extract and build:
   ```bash
   tar -xzvf homeconnect-profile-downloader-macos-package.tar.gz
   cd homeconnect-app
   ./build-macos.sh
   ```

4. The built app will be in the `out/` directory
   
5. Move the .app file to your Applications folder. The first time you run it, right-click and select "Open"

#### Option 2: Build locally from scratch

You can also build and run the application directly on macOS by following these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm  
   - Ensure you have Homebrew installed on your system. If not, install it by following the instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
   - Use Homebrew to install Node.js (version 18) and npm:

     ```bash
     brew install node@18
     ```

   - Follow the brew after installation instructions and open a new terminal window afterwards.

   - After installation, verify the Node.js and npm versions:

     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. Clone the repository  
   - Open a terminal and clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader.git
     ```

3. Navigate to the project directory  
   - Change to the cloned repository's directory:

     ```bash
     cd homeconnect-profile-downloader
     ```

4. Install dependencies  
   - Install the required dependencies using npm:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. Run the application  
   - Start the application with npm:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ installed on your system. You can verify this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If these commands return a version number, Node.js and npm are installed. Otherwise, follow the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to set it up.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd homeconnect-profile-downloader
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
